# 🃏 CRACKJACK 🃏

### *"Definitely Not Rigged"™*

A darkly hilarious roguelike blackjack game where you face off against Satan himself in his rigged casino. Battle through 7 floors of increasingly unfair dealers, collect powerful perks and relics, and try to escape with $10,000 — if the house doesn't destroy you first.
